          <p>
            In 2019 I have completed the bachelors in Computer science at FCUP
            (faculdade de ciencias da universidade do porto). There was a
            strong focus in theoretical mathematical concepts and statistics,
            as well as general computer hardware and software knowledge. I
            completed this course with a final average of 16 (out of 20).

          <p>
            In 2021 I completed my masters degree in data science at
            FCUP (faculdade de ciencias da universidade do porto). In this course a strong focus was placed on machine
            learning, cloud computing and statistics. I finished with a final average of 18 (out of 20). For my
            dissertation a practical problem was approached, involving the identification of the most important power
            transformer gases for failure detection, finding a solution that significantly reduce operational costs.
            With my contributions to the field my dissertation was awarded a grade of 19 (out of 20).

            On the summer of 2019 completed my first internship, in the
            german, Munich based, company HDP (health data pioneers). This was
            an internship on front end web development for a drag and drop
            form creation tool. I used javascript (ES6), REACT and docker. The
            MVP was finished shortly after starting, with posterior iterative
            improvements, both on terms of quantity as well as quality of
            features.

            On the summer of 2020 I completed my second internship, in INESC
            TEC, a portuguese company. The goal of the internship was the use
            of deep learning models as well as hyperparameter tuning and
            transfer learning methodologies to classify point clouds from
            LIDAR. This goal was accomplished with very good results,
            especially, taking into consideration the limitations both in
            terms of the dataset and available computational resources.

          <p>
            From 2020 to 2021 I integrated in a multidisciplinary Efacec lead
            project, including among others MIT, Efacec and INEGI. The
            transformer 4.0 project aims at at bringing the power transformer
            landscape into the new age of the Internet of Things,
            interconnectivity, online monitoring and machine
            learning/artificial intelligence applications. My role in this
            project was as data engineer and machine learning specialist,
            being responsible for full data science pipelines, from data
            interpretation and reporting, to model optimization and
            performance analysis. Initially I was tasked with the identification and solving of various transformer
            related problems, from which a critical one was identified and quickly solved with the aid of machine
            learning, reducing total transformer creation and operating costs by up to 10%.

            identifying the most important Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) gases
            for fault prediction in power transformers.

            In the latter part of my involvement in the transformer 4.0 project I was responsible for the development of
